## Conclusion

The analysis of telecom customer churn has revealed significant factors contributing to customer attrition. Key findings indicate that long-term customers with higher service usage and bundled subscriptions tend to have lower churn rates, while customers experiencing frequent technical issues and high charges are more likely to leave. By addressing these pain points through personalized offers, improved service reliability, and competitive pricing strategies, telecom companies can enhance customer retention and reduce churn rates. The insights gained from this study serve as a valuable foundation for optimizing customer engagement strategies.
